Homework, or homework assignment, refers to tasks assigned to students by 
their teachers to be completed outside the class. Common homework assignments 
may include a quantity or period of reading to be performed, writing 
or typing to be completed, problems to be solved, a school project to 
be built (such as a diorama or display), or other skills to be practiced.
